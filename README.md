This is a environment of Java security by myself !

## Usage

### Way 1

Because this project is based on Spring-Boot Framework. So you can download the release what you want to get. And run the command as follows:

```bash
java -jar JavaSecEnv.jar
```

Then you can visit it by port 9999

Surely, you can also set port as env.

### Way 2

You can also download the source code as follows:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/Roboterh/JavaSecCodeEnv
````

And then open the project via idea or use bash directly!

For idea, you should run the Application.java to run the project.

For bash, you should run the command `mvn clean && mvn package`, and you can find a folder has been created. So you can run the java package via java.
